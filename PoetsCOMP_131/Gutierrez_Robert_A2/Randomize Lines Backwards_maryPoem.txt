Title:  Mary had a little lamb
Author: Sarah Josepha Hale

to see a lamb at school.
He followed her to school one day
Mary had a little lamb,


but still it lingered near,
And so the teacher turned it out,
It made the children laugh and play,
"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know."
till Mary did appear.
And waited patiently about,
the eager children cry.
the lamb was sure to go.
And everywhere that Mary went,
which was against the rule.



whose fleece was white as snow.

the teacher did reply.
"Why does the lamb love Mary so?"
