fade from black int of don corleones home office day


bonasera seated in front of the dons desk facing the camera

i believe in america america has made my fortune and i raised my daughter in the 

american fashion i gave her freedom but i taught her never to dishonor her family she 

found a boyfriend not an italian she went to the movies with him she stayed out late i 

didnt protest two months ago he took her for a drive with another boyfriend they made 

her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her she resisted she kept her 

honor so they beat her like an animal when i went to the hospital her nose was abroken 

her jaw was ashattered held together by wire she couldnt even weep because of the pain 

but i wept why did i weep she was the light of my life beautiful girl now she will 

never be beautiful again

bonasera breaks down the don gestures to sonny to give bonasera a drink

sorry

bonasera taking the drink sips from the shot glass

i i went to the police like a good american these two boys were brought to trial the 

judge sentenced them to three years in prison suspended sentence suspended sentence 

they went free that very day i stood in the courtroom like a fool and those two bastard 

they smiled at me then i said to my wife for justice we must go to don corleone


vito corleone sitting behind his desk petting a cat

why did you go to the police why didnt you come to me first


bonasera

what do you want of me tell me anything but do what i beg you to do


vito corleone

what is that


bonasera gets up to whisper his request into don corleones ear


that i cannot do 


bonasera

ill give you anything you ask


vito corleone

weve known each other many years but this is the first time you came to me for counsel 

for help i cant remember the last time that you invited me to your house for a cup of 

coffee even though my wife is godmother to your only child but lets be frank here you 

never wanted my friendship and uh you were afraid to be in my debt


bonasera

i didnt want to get into trouble


vito corleone

i understand you found paradise in america had a good trade made a good living the 

police protected you and there were courts of law and you didnt need a friend of me but 

uh now you come to me and you say don corleone give me justice but you dont ask 

with respect you dont offer friendship you dont even think to call me godfather instead 

you come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you uh ask me to do 

murder for money


bonasera

i ask you for justice


vito corleone

that is not justice your daughter is still alive


bonasera

then they can suffer then as she suffers 

then

how much shall i pay you


vito corleone stands turning his back toward bonasera

bonasera bonasera what have i ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully had 

you come to me in friendship then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering 

this very day and that by chance if an honest man such as yourself should make enemies 

then they would become my enemies and then they would fear you


bonasera

uh his business is narcotics he has fields in turkey where they grow the poppy and in 

sicily he has the plants to process them into heroin now he needs cash and he needs

tom


tom sollozzo scenes still intercut

well i say yes theres more money potential in narcotics than anything else were looking 

at now if we dont get into it somebody else will maybe one of the five families maybe 

all of them now with the money they earn they can buy more police and political power 

then they come after us now we have the unions we have the gambling an theyre the best 

things to have but narcotics is a thing of the future an if we dont get a piece of that 

action we risk everything we have i mean not now but ah ten years from now


sonny

respect 

then after sitting

but uh i must say no to you and ill give you my reasons its true i have a lot of friends 

in politics but they wouldnt be friendly very long if they knew my business was drugs 

instead of gambling which they rule that as a harmless vice but drugs is a dirty business


sollozzo

don corleone

i found out about this captain mccluskey who broke mikes jaw


sonny

what about im


tom

now hes definitely on sollozzos payroll and for big money mccluskey has agreed to be 

the turks bodyguard what you have to understand sonny is that while sollozzo is being 

guarded like this he is invulnerable now nobody has ever gunned down a new york police 

captain never it would be disastrous all the five families would come after you sonny 

the corleone family would be outcasts even the old mans political protection would run 

for cover so do me a favor take this into consideration

dissolve to bank building boardroom in new york city there are dons and aides 

seated and standing around a conference table barzini sits at the head of the table day


vito corleone

don barzini i want to thank you for helping me organize this meeting here today and 

also the other heads of the five families new york and new jersey carmine corleone 

from the bronx and ah brooklyn philip tattaglia an from staten island we have 

with us victor strachi and all the other associates that came as far as from california and 

kansas city and all the other territories of the country thank you

then sitting down

how did things ever get so far i dont know it was so unfortunate so unnecessary 

tattaglia lost a son and i lost a son were quits and if tattaglia agrees then im willing 

to let things go on the way they were before


barzini

were all grateful to don corleone for calling this meeting we all know him as a man of his 

word a modest man hell always listen to reason


tattaglia

yes don barzini hes too modest he had all the judges and politicians in his pocket he 

refused to share them


vito corleone

when when did i ever refuse an accommodation all of you know me here when did i 

ever refuse except one time and why because i believe this drug business is gonna 

destroy us in the years to come i mean its not like gambling or liquor even women 

which is something that most people want nowadays and is ah forbidden to them by the 

pezzonovante of the church even the police departments thatve helped us in the past with 

gambling and other things are gonna refuse to help us when in comes to narcotics and i 

believed that then and i believe that now


barzini

times have changed its not like the old days when we can do anything we want a 

refusal is not the act of a friend if don corleone had all the judges and the politicians in 

new york then he must share them or let us others use them he must let us draw the water 

from the well certainly he can present a bill for such services after all we are not 

communists


zaluchi after some laughter from the group stands

i also dont believe in drugs for years i paid my people extra so they wouldnt do that kind 

of business 


tattaglia whispers something to his aide


zaluchi continues

 somebody comes to them and says i have powders if you put up three four thousand 

dollar investment we can make fifty thousand distributing so they cant resist i want to 

control it as a business to keep it respectable

then as he slams his hand on the table

i dont want it near schools i dont want it sold to children thats an infamia in my city 

we would keep the traffic in the dark people the colored theyre animals anyway so let 

them lose their souls


vito corleone

i hoped that we would come here and reason together and as a reasonable man im willing 

to do whatevers necessary to find a peaceful solution to these problems


barzini

then we are agreed the traffic in drugs will be permitted but controlled and don 

corleone will give up protection in the east and there will be the peace


tattaglia

but i must have strict assurance from corleone as time goes by and his position becomes 

stronger will he attempt any individual vendetta


barzini

look we are all reasonable men here we dont have to give assurances as if we were 

lawyers


vito corleone holding up his hand to interrupt barzini

you talk about vengeance is vengeance gonna bring your son back to you or my boy to 

me i forgo the vengeance of my son but i have selfish reasons my youngest son was 

forced to leave this country 

then as he stands with toms assistance

 because of this sollozzo business all right and i have to make arrangements to bring 

him back here safely cleared of all these false charges but im a superstitious man and 

if some unlucky accident should befall him if he should get shot in the head by a police 

officer or if he should hang himself in his jail cell or if hes struck by a bolt of 

lightning then im going to blame some of the people in this room and that i do not 

forgive

then

but that aside let me say that i swear on the souls of my grandchildren that i will 

not be the one to break the peace that we have made here today


the don and tom move toward the head of the table where barzini is sitting 

tattaglia does the same the don and tattaglia embrace as the others applaud


cut to the dons car driving night

cut to inside the car where the don and tom are sitting in the rear night


tom

when i meet with the tattaglia people should i insist that all his drug middlemen have 

clean records


vito corleone

mention it dont insist barzini is a man wholl know that without being told


tom

you mean tattaglia


vito corleone
