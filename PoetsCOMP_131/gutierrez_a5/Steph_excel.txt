Dear Excel Academy,      I am Stephanie Gutierrez and I am currently a sixth grader here in Lynn.  Over the past few years I have been tying to enroll, but have had little success in getting in and have ended up in the waiting list. My brother Robert Gutierrez used to go to this school when it had just open back in 2006.  Since then have always been interested in going to Excel.  Currently I live in Lynn and understand the distance, but I am really determined just as my brother was.  I believe that going to Excel Academy would be a great opportunity for me. As I hear that the community is really invested in their classes and academics, something I believe I need. A thing I believe IÕm not getting here Lynn Public School system.  I really have a strong desire to attend your school, and hope to be accepted in the near future.  I would really appreciate being notified on any information you/I may need along the process, and once again  would like to thank you for your time in reading this letter.Sincerely, Stephanie S. Gutierrez
