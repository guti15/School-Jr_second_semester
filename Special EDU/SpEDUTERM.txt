However, as we trace back history we see that it was not like that the whole time.  For instance the Romans took it as far as killing their own baby.  Something that seems absurdly gruesome; which makes me wonder the mother’s perspective, especially when they were the ones that were pregnant for nine months.         In addition in Greece having a baby with a disability was thought as the worst thing that could have happen to the family.  Subtle things that we see day by day we forget that these customs are relatively new and that things did not always work the way they do now.   Often times many children with disabilities were abandoned left in obscure places hoping for someone to find them and deal with them.  They were also displayed in town squares as an object of amusement or degrading them and taking their human rights.  Many also ended up in circuses and considered “freaks”.          In all reality this seems like a stretched lie especially when looking at now, how we try our best as a society to accommodate them, make them a part of our society. However, the main time frame where aid began to be looked as a possible treatment was in 1600’s when a French Monk, named Ponce DeLeon tried to teach a group of deaf people to talk.   Treacherous water for the Monk at the time, especially when suggesting such a radical idea that had not been suggested before.  We may take it for granted now but advocating such radical idea at the time was not the easiest, but as time went on we did manage to see progress. In addition we begin to see heavier improvement later around WWII where we get the idea that medicine could potentially be a possibility to cure certain types of disability.  But perhaps the biggest historically improvement is Alexander Graham Bell.  As a bystander of the situation due to his wife and mother becoming deaf, he demonstrated that deaf people were not in fact dumb, and that they were actually manageable and teachable individuals.  Hence, starting the Boston School for the Deaf.  This type of movement is what has caused us to progress and make such ground breaking discoveries, of people mental and physical state.         Disability and litigation have gone fairly well, and we have seen a lot of positive feed back that has, given more freedom and rights to people with disabilities.  Litigation has been very beneficial for the fact that raises the problems to a court where it can be deem right or wrong legally.  Often times we have seen justice be served and acknowledged to defend, and protect the people with disabilities.  For example the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children vs the Commonwealth of Penn.   Created a guideline in how to deem it correct to separate students with mental disability.   Which stated that a student needed at least mental age of 5 to be considered trainable if not they would have to be accommodate at another place with programs that could potentially fit the child needs, and it was considered essential to consider early education to the child.  These type of guidelines are what are missing many of the time.  A source of documentation that makes it possible to reference to, and see what is considered correct.   Of course not always does the law state then, but rising such issues are necessary to create a positive change and promote education to children with disability in order to commit to progress.
